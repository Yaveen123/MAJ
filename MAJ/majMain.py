The original intention of this game was to be able go through a maze and dodge certain enemies:
- Matt, where you had to shift a code cypher for to decode a coffee machine.
- Anil, where you had to solve a maths problem
- Jeff, where you had to find his hat
However the scale of the project exceeded the time limit set for this project.
